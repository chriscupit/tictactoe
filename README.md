React TicTakToe Game

Description
This assignment/project was to refactor a simple tictactoe game and learn how data is passed back and forth from parent to child.  

Roadmap for Future Improvements
The first thing I would do is have the game stop once a winner is decided.  Currently the game still allows for a user to continue clicking on the squares while still displaying the winner.  Im sure there are multiple ways to do it but I believe the buttons could be disabled if the (win.length > 0) is returned for player X or O. I would also change some of the coloring within the styles.css page.  Lastly, I would like to have a "new game" button that would reset the game or reload the page once a winner is reached.
